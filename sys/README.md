# Rust FFI bindings for ffmpeg

Low-level bindings for ffmpeg autogenerated with bindgen. This crate supports cross-compilation automatically.

For higher-level library, see [ffmpeg crate](https://lib.rs/ffmpeg).

## Building

By default, the crate will search for ffmpeg v4 installed on the system.

This crate can also download, build and statically link its own copy of ffmpeg if you enable `build` feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
ffmpeg-sys = { version = "4", features = ["build"] }
```

See [Cargo features](https://github.com/meh/rust-ffmpeg/blob/HEAD/Cargo.toml) to control which codecs are included.
